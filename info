Feedback for Kusha – IT Lead, Testing Automation Suite

Working with Kusha over the past year has been both inspiring and productive. He brings exceptional energy, creativity, and depth of understanding to every discussion. His entrepreneurial mindset has been central to the evolution of our automation capabilities — many of today’s key solutions, such as Compass and Data Guard, trace back to his early side-of-desk initiatives. He consistently demonstrates a rare ability to connect diverse value-stream requirements into cohesive, scalable solutions that genuinely improve efficiency and coverage.

Equally impressive is his collaborative spirit. Kusha engages constructively with stakeholders, listens carefully, and contributes ideas that elevate the overall quality of delivery. His passion for innovation and his hands-on approach to problem-solving make him a true catalyst for progress. As we advance toward a fully integrated, end-to-end automation suite, I look forward to working even more closely with him to turn that vision into reality.

Would you like me to make a slightly more personal version (keeping professionalism but sounding more peer-to-peer rather than formal HR tone)?
