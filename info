We recommend an estimate of six IT resources to support the creation and expansion of the testing automation solution. The core solution is already in progress, but as it evolves with new requirements, discussions with IT indicate that approximately six resources will be needed.

Would you like me to make this slightly more formal, as in a proposal or leadership presentation tone (e.g., “It is proposed that…”)?
