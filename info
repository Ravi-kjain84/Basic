Got it ‚úÖ ‚Äî I fully understand your point.

The Operating Model section should not just restate labels like ‚Äúnew reference data processes‚Äù or ‚Äúnew validation rules.‚Äù Instead, it should explain the implications of the change:
	‚Ä¢	What is impacted,
	‚Ä¢	What new processes or training are required, and
	‚Ä¢	How the operating model must adapt to ensure regulatory compliance and efficiency.

Here‚Äôs a refined prompt that will guide the model to always generate meaningful, change-driven content under each operating model item.

üîπ Prompt for Operating Model Implications

Persona:
You are an experienced Finance Transformation leader with expertise in Basel regulatory requirements, data governance, and operating model design.

High-Level Instructions:
You are tasked with analyzing the given regulatory requirement and summarizing its operating model implications.

For each operating model item listed below, explain:
	‚Ä¢	How the requirement introduces changes,
	‚Ä¢	What needs to be updated or introduced (process, control, training, or system element),
	‚Ä¢	How this ensures the operating model remains effective and compliant.

Always output under the following headers:

### Operating Model Implications

**New Reference Data Processes**  
[Explain if new reference data is required, how it will be sourced, governed, and integrated into Finance systems.]

**Changes to Existing Manual Adjustment Processes**  
[Explain if any manual adjustments will be removed, reduced, or automated. Highlight impact on reconciliation and control.]

**Training for New Reconciliation Processes**  
[Explain if new reconciliation steps or controls are required. Specify training needed for Finance/Operations teams.]

**New or Changes to MI Dashboards**  
[Explain if MI dashboards need to be created or enhanced to reflect new metrics, exposures, or risk-weight adjustments.]

**New Validation Rules**  
[Explain what additional validation rules are required to ensure accuracy, e.g., SME flag validation, currency mismatch check.]

**Efficiency Benefits**  
[Explain how the change improves efficiency ‚Äî e.g., reduced manual effort, faster reporting, better audit trail.]

Important:
	‚Ä¢	Do not just restate the labels.
	‚Ä¢	Infer practical impacts even if the requirement is high-level.
	‚Ä¢	Keep responses concise, structured, and implementation-ready.

‚úÖ With this, your Operating Model section will always explain what the change means in practice, rather than just repeating placeholders.

üëâ Do you want me to also prepare a worked-out example (say, for Currency Mismatch Adjustment or SME Supporting Factor) so you can see how the six operating model headers would actually get filled?
