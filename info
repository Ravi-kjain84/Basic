Subject: RE: Gen AI & Automation demo: Testing CoE Priorities and Targets

Dear Dishan and Shubha,

Thank you both for your messages and for outlining the current priorities and challenges on the F4 delivery.

I completely understand the intensity of the UAT phase and appreciate the extended hours the team is currently putting in. While I agree with Dishan’s suggestion to revisit the Testing CoE KPIs for F4 during October–November, I would like to highlight that any immediate workload concerns, especially around the 12–14 hour working days, should be addressed proactively.

If the team can provide a walkthrough of the current testing or governance processes, I would be happy to assess whether any immediate automation or process efficiencies can be introduced to ease the current pressure. Even a small intervention might offer some relief.

Also, please note that we remain open to reviewing and applying the Testing CoE KPIs on a project-specific basis, depending on the context and stage of delivery.

For a structured and detailed KPI review, we can schedule time in October as proposed. In the meantime, do let me know if a quick connect is possible to explore any short-term support options.

Kind regards,
Ravi
