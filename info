Subject: GenAI Test Case Review – Points of Contact and Upcoming Demo

Hi Srinidhar,

Fred has suggested serving as the single point of contact for FinGroup RegReporting, and as you noted, he could also cover ALCM. I would like to emphasize, however, that from the review standpoint—especially for GenAI-generated test cases, automation opportunities, JIRA usage, and reusable test cases—we would still expect independent inputs from both ALCM and RWA. This will help ensure that any distinct observations across the two reporting streams are adequately captured.

I’ll be sending out a meeting invite for next week to walk through the automated solution options and the GenAI solution. Please feel free to suggest if there’s anyone else from the Liquidity team who should be included in the session.

Best regards,
Ravi
