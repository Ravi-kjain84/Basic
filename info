Subject: RE: Next steps: Testing CoE Priorities and Targets

Hi Atifa,

The Treasury leads were selected based on data collated by Vignesh / Rob, focusing on those with 100% testing resources reporting to them (e.g., Unit Test, Regression Test, UAT, etc.). The attached list reflects these allocations.

Grateful if you could suggest colleagues to join the working group—ideally those involved in testing execution, automation, or JIRA-based test case management. We plan to demo existing automation tools and guide them on GenAI use cases. I’ll be supporting the group in identifying reusable test cases and addressing JIRA-related gaps.

Best regards,
Ravi
