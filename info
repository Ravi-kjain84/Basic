Subject: RE: Gurugram Visit

Hi Asha,

Kiran will be in the Gurgaon office from 15th to 17th July. Could you please help schedule a one-on-one with Arpita during this period?

We’ve already booked Meeting Room 01 (VC) (8) [Zone 2] for all three days, so we can use this room for the discussion.

Kindly confirm which day works best for the face-to-face meeting. Once it’s scheduled, please do let me know the time slot so I can plan Kiran’s other meetings accordingly.

Thanks and regards,
Ravi Kumar Jain

Let me know if you’d like to make the tone more formal or more casual.
