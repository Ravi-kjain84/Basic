Understood. So for the Scope in the first slide, we should:
	•	Avoid re-listing the artifacts (since they’re already in Objectives).
	•	Keep it high-level but concrete.
	•	Emphasize participation from the nominated Value Streams/projects.

Here’s a clean revision of the Scope section:

⸻

Scope
	•	Focus on delivery artifacts defined in Objectives.
	•	Nominated Value Streams and projects to participate in PoC.
	•	Collaborative effort across Finance and Tech teams.

⸻

This keeps it short, avoids duplication, and makes clear who’s involved.

Do you want me to rebuild the full streamlined slide draft with this updated Scope included, so it’s all tied together neatly?
