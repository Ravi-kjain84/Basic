Subject: Request for Demo – Testing COE Solutions and GenAI Progress

Hi Rachel, Adrian,

As we discussed, we’ve been running a POC as part of the June month-end pilot under the Testing COE. We’ve made good progress and identified a few working solutions that can help automate parts of the process and improve efficiency, quality, and governance.

We’re also working on a Generative AI solution, which has shown strong potential in generating high-quality test cases. I’ve raised a formal use case and am collaborating with Piyush Gupta to take this forward. In parallel, we’re in discussions with the IWPB team to see if we can align our efforts with their solution. Treasury IT is also working with us on this.

I’d be happy to walk you through a quick demo of what we’ve built so far, what’s in progress, and the direction we’re heading. Please let me know a convenient time.

Best regards,
Ravi
Testing Center of Excellence Lead
