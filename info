Subject: RE: Follow-up on AI Test Automation Discussion (minutes)

Hi Simar,

Hope you’re doing well!

To briefly introduce myself—I’m Ravi Jain, currently leading the Testing CoE for Finance value streams and projects. As part of a strategic initiative, we’ve initiated a GenAI use case for automated test case creation.

Following a suggestion from Ruchan Candar (Head of Finance Transformation), we recently connected with the IWPB team, who are working on a similar use case. The Treasury IT team is also progressing with a comparable initiative.

Last week, we had a joint discussion (involving Treasury IT, Finance Transformation, and Treasury IT) and agreed to explore the possibility of collaborating toward a single solution that can be adopted bank-wide.

Simon recommended I connect with you, as you’re leading the overall project. I’m proposing to set up a quick call for this Wednesday or Thursday to align on objectives. Based on that discussion, we plan to form a working group with representatives from all three areas.

Please let me know your availability for a quick connect. I’ll coordinate the invite accordingly.
