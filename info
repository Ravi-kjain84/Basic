I understand Tejender is already providing you with details for the weekly updates. To streamline this, it would be helpful if you could share your input template, which we can then populate before having a connect scheduled.

I will be on leave today and Friday, so request you to reschedule the call to mid-next week. Please keep Teji, Kush, and Amit in the loop for these updates on a regular basis.

On deliverables, we have clarity on Q4 2025 as of now. Q1 2026 deliverables will be finalized based on what we are able to achieve. Just one correction on the strategic point mentioned earlier: it should not be described as “human-free testing.” Instead, it should highlight enhanced controls, governance, and automation. We can align further on this in our next call.
