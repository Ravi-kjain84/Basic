Subject: Invite: AI Use Case POC – Next Steps Discussion

Hi all,

As we have now collated the nominations from various value streams for participation in the AI Use Case POC, we would like to bring everyone together to align on the next steps.

This session will cover:
	•	Discussion of the nominated use case
	•	Agreement on acceptance criteria
	•	Key aspects to be included in the POC
	•	Next steps and responsibilities

We are in the process of arranging the necessary accesses for CIB. In the meantime, let’s connect on Thursday to align on the way forward.

Looking forward to the discussion.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Would you like me to also draft a calendar invite description version of this (shorter, bullet-pointed, more “meeting-note” style), so you can directly paste it in the meeting invite?
