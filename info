Absolutely. Here’s the refined version with:
	•	A more assertive but neutral transition (replacing “That said”),
	•	Stronger emphasis on timelines,
	•	Clear but professional tone throughout.

Subject: RE: Requirements Walkthrough – TCoE Testing

Hi Seema,

As suggested, I will reschedule the discussion.

Given the number of prior reschedules, I would like to emphasise the importance of including this in the Q4 release timeline. Most of the initial solution design, pseudo-code, and solution testing has already been completed as part of the PoC, and we are expecting tangible process efficiency gains through its implementation.

Considering the positive outcomes from the PoC, we are also aligning other value stream testing teams with this solution and conducting demos to enable wider adoption.

Please let me know if there are any constraints or risks from your end that we should account for, so that we can ensure timely delivery within Q4.

Best regards,
