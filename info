Subject: Next Steps on HSBC Productivity Suite POC

Hi All,

Following up with Rob’s support, all nominated colleagues have now received access to the HSBC productivity suite. We should decide whether to start the POC with this suite, or wait for access to the IWPB solution—since the CIB option does not appear to be moving forward.

Separately, I had asked nominees to place their requirements in a separate folder without setting timelines. However, it seems this will not gain traction unless we actively push for it.

Hi Sarfaraz, could you please take the lead in helping us drive this forward? Perhaps we can schedule a few sessions to push nominees and agree timelines. Let’s discuss this in today’s 1 PM call.

If we agree to proceed with the POC, we can aim to start as early as next week. In that case, I suggest you set up the check-in calls we discussed for the next two weeks.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

Do you want me to make this more formal (for leadership visibility) or keep it at this working-level tone for team coordination?
