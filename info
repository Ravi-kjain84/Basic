That makes sense — if the central team isn’t “delivering artifacts” but instead enabling and guiding, then the checkpoints should highlight:
	•	what support the central team provides,
	•	what participation/outputs are expected from Value Streams, and
	•	where alignment/feedback loops happen.

Here’s a reframed version of the AI PoC Plan checkpoints with that lens:

⸻

Pre-PoC Preparation
	•	Central Team: Secure tool access (IWPB, CiB, Treasury IT), prepare evaluation templates, align with VS leads.
	•	Value Streams: Identify PoC use cases, prep prompts, review evaluation method.

⸻

Week 1

Checkpoint 1
	•	Central team: Kick-off, confirm access and readiness.
	•	VSs: Reconfirm nominated participants and scope of use cases.

Checkpoint 2
	•	Central team: Share objectives, expectations, and templates.
	•	VSs: Start working independently with AI tool.

Checkpoint 3
	•	Central team: Provide prompt guidance and clarifications.
	•	VSs: Generate initial outputs for their domain and log observations.

⸻

Week 2

Checkpoint 4
	•	Central team: Collect early feedback, resolve issues, ensure consistency in evaluation.
	•	VSs: Continue using tool and refine use cases.

Checkpoint 5
	•	Central team: Facilitate interim review across VSs.
	•	VSs: Submit consolidated observations using templates.

Checkpoint 6
	•	Central team: Wrap-up, collate results, prepare pack for FAMM/AerCo.
	•	VSs: Share final feedback and confirm completion.

⸻

This way, the artifacts stay internal to VSs, while your slide clearly shows:
	•	what the central team is doing at each checkpoint,
	•	what’s expected from Value Streams in return.

Would you like me to also re-draw this plan into your timeline slide format (so you’ll have the filled checkpoints in PowerPoint, not just text)?
