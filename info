Here is a professionally worded and concise version of your explanation to share with Atifa:

⸻

Hi Atifa,

The leads for Treasury were selected based on the data collated by Rob from various value streams, including Treasury. The rationale behind the selection was the reporting structure—specifically, individuals under these leads who are 100% involved in testing activities. Based on this data, the identified leads have direct responsibility for the testing resources and were therefore included.

Please let me know if you need any further details.

Best regards,
Ravi
