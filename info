Subject: Query Regarding Alteryx Permanent License Cost

Hi Matt,

I hope you’re doing well.

To briefly introduce myself, I’m Ravi Jain, currently leading the Testing Centre of Excellence and reporting to Rushan Kandar, Head of Finance Transformation. As part of my responsibilities, I am evaluating various automation solutions, including Google Data Studio, Python-based workflows, and also Alteryx for regression dashboarding—particularly for testing-related use cases.

Based on my discussion with Fred and inputs from other teams, Alteryx appears to be a viable option. I am therefore looking to initiate a request for a permanent license. Before proceeding, I had a quick query regarding the associated cost.

From what I understand, the estimated cost is around USD 2,000. Could you kindly confirm if this amount is accurate? Additionally, please clarify whether this is a one-time fee or an annual subscription charge.

This information will help me have an informed discussion with my line manager regarding the feasibility and value of adopting Alteryx for our needs. Also, please let me know the process for raising the XA and applying for the license.

Thank you in advance for your guidance.

Best regards,
Ravi Jain
