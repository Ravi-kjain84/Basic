Summary of Discussion with Simon Chhen – IWPB Central Testing Lead

1. Funding and Resource Allocation Model
	•	Resource allocation is linked to funding received from VSIP and is proportionally distributed.
	•	The model allows for resources to be drawn from site-based teams or from specific value streams reporting directly into Simon.

2. Flexi Pool and SME Structure
	•	A flexi-pool model is in place, allowing dynamic allocation of testing resources.
	•	Value streams will continue to have their own testing SMEs, while the central pool enables flexibility and cross-support.
	•	Certain key SMEs can train others, enhancing capability maturity across streams.

3. Internal Technology Capability
	•	A separate technology team exists to support test automation and tooling needs.
	•	This structure is designed to reduce dependency on broader IT if needed.
	•	Initially, an automation architect was hired, followed by expansion of the automation team.

4. UAT and Change vs. BAU Focus
	•	The IWPB testing team primarily focuses on change initiatives, not BAU.
	•	UAT activities must be handled via BAU channels unless part of a structured change initiative.

5. Testing Team Leadership at Value Stream Level
	•	Each value stream is encouraged to have a testing team lead to coordinate testing activities and act as the local point of accountability.

6. Pod vs. Testing Resource Alignment
	•	When the number of Agile pods exceeds the number of dedicated testers, resource allocation may be done as a percentage split across pods.
	•	This enables optimized utilization of limited testing bandwidth.

7. Benefits of a Central Pool
	•	Enables cross-utilization of resources during high-demand periods.
	•	Allows ring-fencing of certain resources to value streams, offering them assurance of continuity.
	•	Facilitates skill transfer and SME development across teams.
	•	Acts as a scalable model—resources can flex between BAU, UAT, and change programs as needed.

8. Tracking and Visibility
	•	Emphasis was placed on tracking initial vs. peak resource allocation for testing across value streams.
	•	Understanding this will help validate efficiency and support planning and funding conversations.

Suggested Additions (Based on Discussion Direction)
	1.	Governance Structure
	•	Consider implementing a formal governance mechanism to track central pool utilization, value stream satisfaction, and cross-stream allocations.
	•	Periodic reviews can help maintain balance between flexibility and accountability.
	2.	Onboarding and Rotation Model
	•	A lightweight onboarding/rotation framework for testers moving across value streams could accelerate delivery and maintain context.
	3.	Central Test Asset Repository
	•	A shared repository for test cases, automation assets, and reusable components can enhance reusability across the central pool.
	4.	Performance and Utilization Metrics
	•	Tracking test coverage, defect leakage, and tester utilization across the flexi-pool will help justify the model during audits or funding reviews.
	5.	Knowledge Continuity Plan
	•	For the central pool to remain effective, especially under cross-utilization, establish a mechanism for handover documentation and knowledge transfer between assignments.
	6.	Role Definitions
	•	Define clear role boundaries for:
	•	Central test pool SME vs. value stream tester
	•	Automation developer vs. business SME
	•	Testing team lead responsibilities across hybrid/central structures

Subject: Extending AI POC Evaluation and License Requirement

Dear [Head of Finance Transformation’s Name],

As we are already working on the AI test case generation POC with the IWPB team, the initiative has been very useful and is showing promising results. We also came across other AI pilots they are running, and expanding our evaluation to the full suite will help us assess the broader benefits for Finance Transformation.

To carry out a structured evaluation, we will need to involve multiple value streams, and an initial allocation of around 20 licenses will enable us to consolidate findings and move toward a formal report and target go-live by November.

It would be great if you could connect with Maxim to discuss the license allocation and broaden our collaboration with IWPB.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Testing CoE Lead

This version is:
	•	Shorter and easy to scan for executives.
	•	Keeps the collaborative and positive tone.
	•	Retains all key points: current POC, expansion, license need, timeline, and next step.

If you want, I can shrink it further into a 4–5 line executive note for very quick reading.

Would you like me to prepare that version too?
