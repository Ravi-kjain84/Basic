Subject: RE: Gen AI Use Case Preparation

Hi Charlie,

Thank you for sharing these well-thought-out ideas. I believe many of them are quite feasible and worth exploring further. It will require some joint discussions and planning to shape them effectively.

Starting with the initial set of requirements you highlighted sounds like a good approach. I’ll go ahead and schedule a call for next week to take this forward.

Appreciate your continued support.

Best regards,
Ravi
