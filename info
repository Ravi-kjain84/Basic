Got it. Here’s the revised draft with the correct tone, reflecting that you are initiating the discussion and will propose (not yet request) the access numbers:

Subject: Access Planning for AI Pilot – Finance Transformation

Dear Simar,

Hope you are doing well.

As suggested by Maxim, we are initiating discussions on the access requirements for the AI solution as part of the pilot collaboration. Before we propose this formally, we wanted to check with you if there are any constraints or considerations from your side regarding the number of users that can be granted access.

We are currently thinking of proposing access for at least 5% of the user base, which would be approximately 100 users, based on an estimated population of around 2,000 colleagues. This is to ensure sufficient coverage for meaningful engagement during the pilot phase.

Please let us know if this scale would be manageable, or if there are any limitations we should be aware of before moving forward.

Thank you for all your support.

Best regards,
Ravi Jain
On behalf of the Finance Transformation team

Would you like me to create two alternate phrasings for the second paragraph (less formal but still professional) so you can choose the one that sounds best?
