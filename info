Instructions:
1. Each requirement starts with a marker in the format “[REQ-####] …”.
2. Treat everything that follows (questions, answers, metadata) as belonging to that requirement, until the next “[REQ-####]” marker.
3. For each requirement, create a separate table with:
   - Requirement ID
   - Question
   - Answer
   - Score
4. Do not mix content between different requirements. Always start a new table at each “[REQ-####]” marker.
