Great, thanks for sharing the updated slide. Right now, it looks comprehensive but slightly word-heavy. I’ve compressed the language while keeping all the essence and impact intact. Here’s the tightened version for your PPT:

⸻

Testing Center of Excellence

Objective
	•	Drive efficiency via cross-utilization of resources across value streams.
	•	Scale Automation and AI solutions effectively.
	•	Achieve phased gains: ~15% from automation and ~15% from AI within 6–18 months (2026–27).

⸻

Current Challenges
	•	Low automation and redundant manual effort.
	•	Inconsistent test quality and traceability.
	•	UAT misaligned with production.

⸻

Strategic Approach
	•	Central Pool: Flexible resource allocation and cross-use.
	•	Automation & Gen AI: Test automation + AI-driven test case generation.
	•	Training: Rotate resources for rapid skill growth.

⸻

Benefits
	•	Cost Reduction: ~30% savings (15% automation + 15% AI).
	•	Quality: Broader coverage and early defect detection.
	•	Optimization: Manage peak loads and future demand.

⸻

Implementation Plan
	•	Align resources to CoE, map skills, deploy AI.
	•	Embed testers in Agile teams for planning and execution.
	•	Scale AI automation in phases to achieve targets.

⸻

Future State
	•	Agile-ready, AI-driven test case generation.
	•	Continuous KPI/OKR-based improvement.
	•	Scalable ecosystem for evolving business and regulatory needs.

✅ Now the text is 30–35% shorter, but every major point remains intact.
This will read better in a presentation, while the executive summary slide you requested earlier can complement it.

Would you like me to also design a visual flow (icons + 6-block model: Objective → Challenges → Approach → Benefits → Implementation → Future) so it looks even cleaner for leadership?
