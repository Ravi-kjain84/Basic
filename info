Subject: Testing COE – Centralised Resource Model Implementation

Dear Steven,

As part of the broader effort to strengthen consistency and scalability across Finance Transformation, the Testing COE has been reviewing how testing resources are organised and governed. A key outcome of this review is the move towards a centralised, centre-led resource model that supports all value streams while maintaining their flexibility and domain focus.

Under this structure, testing SMEs will remain soft ring-fenced to their respective value streams to preserve continuity, while the central pool will enable more dynamic allocation of capacity, shared expertise, and better responsiveness during peak demand. The model is designed to:
	•	Strengthen governance and quality through common standards and oversight.
	•	Build deeper technical and domain capability through cross-stream exposure and shared learning.
	•	Accelerate automation and AI-enabled testing practices for improved efficiency and insight.
	•	Optimise utilisation across programmes without additional headcount.

This direction is fully aligned with the broader COE vision of developing shared capabilities and integrated frameworks across Finance Transformation.

We will set up a call for next week to discuss the implementation approach and align on next steps collaboratively.

Best regards,
Ravi Jain
Testing COE Lead – Finance Transformation
