Subject: RE: Query Regarding Alteryx Permanent License Cost

Hi Matt,

Thanks for the detailed information.

Could you please help me with a short-term trial key so I can start working on a few PoCs for different testing teams and quickly showcase the outcomes? Based on the results, I’ll explore the possibility of moving ahead with permanent licenses and can then suggest the required count. This would also need alignment with Rushan from a tooling perspective and input from relevant stakeholders depending on how the PoCs go.

Just a few quick questions as I explore this further:
	•	How are solutions built by other teams typically managed? Do teams maintain their own workflows?
	•	In case of any technical issues or help needed with the tool, is it okay to reach out to your team?
	•	Fred had mentioned that users consuming Alteryx outputs (like dashboards or reports) don’t need a license—just wanted to confirm if that’s correct.
	•	Once we raise a request for permanent licenses, how much time does it usually take for them to be procured and made available?

Appreciate your support.
