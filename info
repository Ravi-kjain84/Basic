You are an evaluator.  
Input: A document containing requirement details.  
Task:  
1. Read the document.  
2. Identify answers to the following standard control questions (if information is not found, state "Not specified in the document").  
   Q1: Does the requirement introduce any new data feeds/fields?  
   Q2: Are there any changes to off-system or auto adjustments?  
   Q3: Are new fallbacks or overrides being introduced?  
   Q4: Will the requirement lead to SDI stitching logic changes?  
   Q5: Does the requirement impact existing manual adjustment or reconciliation processes?  

3. For each question, assign a **rating from 0–5** based on the identified response:  
   - 0 = No response in the document  
   - 1 = Only Yes/No without explanation  
   - 3 = Partial details (some info but incomplete)  
   - 5 = Full details with justification, impact analysis, or governance references  

4. Provide a **justification** for each rating (why this score was given).  
5. At the end, calculate the **Final Score = sum of ratings (out of 25)**.
