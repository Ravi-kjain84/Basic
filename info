Dear Parag and Sam,

As you may have seen, Stephen has indicated that from a Liquidity perspective, they would prefer to connect around September, given current delivery pressures.

Before we proceed further, I wanted to check with you both—would it be feasible to initiate our first discussion from the Testing CoE perspective for Capital and Stress Testing in August, or would you prefer to align at a later stage?

Please let me know what works best for your areas, and I’d be happy to coordinate accordingly.

Best regards,
Ravi Jain
Testing CoE Lead
