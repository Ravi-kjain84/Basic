Excellent — that’s the right instinct. Leaving “Even better if” blank would indeed look incomplete. Here’s a revised, balanced version (~160 words) that keeps the praise substantive but adds a constructive, forward-looking “Even better if” aligned with your tone and relationship:

Hi Seema, Graham,

Hope you are doing well. As Kushagra requested feedback as part of his year-end review, please find below my comments.

What went well:
Kushagra has been instrumental in driving the evolution of our testing automation suite. He combines strong technical expertise with an entrepreneurial mindset, consistently transforming complex requirements into practical and scalable solutions. Several of our key initiatives, including Compass and Data Guard, originated from his earlier innovative work and continue to influence our direction. His collaborative approach, creativity, and problem-solving drive have greatly strengthened cross–value stream alignment and efficiency.

Even better if:
As we move toward a fully integrated end-to-end automation suite, Kushagra could focus on broadening the adoption of these tools across additional value streams and deepening integration with testing and reporting workflows. This would help maximize the reach and visibility of the excellent work already achieved.

Would you like me to make it slightly more assertive in tone (for managerial-level submission) or keep this balanced and collegial version?
