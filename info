Subject: RE: Request for one GitHub Copilot Access for Testing CoE Initiatives

Hi Ruchan,

At this stage, I’m requesting approval for one user access (myself). This will help me understand the approval process and any nuances before extending the request to others.

The approval process is stringent and tightly controlled by IT. This request will only cover step 4d below, after which I’ll apply for the remaining steps.

Please find the Co-pilot Access Request Process details below for reference.

Would you like me to make a slightly more formal version (for forwarding to senior stakeholders or IT)?
