Subject: Request for Discussion on DAP-Aligned Features and Capabilities (as referred by Graham)

Dear Kostav,

I hope you‚Äôre doing well.

I am Ravi Jain, currently leading the Testing CoE and reporting to Roshan.

As referred by Graham in the email below, I wanted to connect with you regarding the DAP-aligned structure of features and capabilities.

We are currently working on a Testing CoE initiative where, based on a POC, we have identified and are in the process of raising requests for IT development to support automation of test case generation. To progress further, we need to map our technical requirements to DAP-aligned features and capabilities.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could help me understand the DAP structure or guide me to the appropriate contact who can walk me through it.

Please let me know if a short call can be scheduled at your convenience.

Best regards,
Ravi Kumar Jain
