Subject: RE: Next steps: Testing CoE Priorities and Targets

Hi Stephen,

Sure, we can do a demo. I would, however, suggest including a walkthrough from the Liquidity team as well, to understand how they are building their regression dashboard. Currently, IT is developing a range of solutions—from high-level testing (individual SQLs) to regression dashboard preparation. A walkthrough from Liquidity would help us decide where automation IT should focus (and where to enhance, if required).

For GenAI, we have broadened the PoC scope from Testing into end-to-end Transformation tasks. This includes starting from requirement policy documents and using AI to create JIRA requirement templates, epics, JIRA stories, and test cases.

For the PoC, we have requested 20 accesses from IWPB and CIB solutions (where we are collaborating with other teams in the pilot phase). We have nominations from various value streams, but none yet from Liquidity. We can go into more detail during the demo. I’ve attached the pack for reference.

We should also align on access distribution, as the limited number of accesses may pose a challenge.

Regards,

Would you like me to also give you a shorter version (more executive-style, cutting details down to the essentials), or do you want to keep the detail for this audience?
