Subject: Update on Canary Environment for Pre-Prod

Hi [Recipient’s Name],

I spoke with Vasudha regarding the canary environment for pre-prod. It is currently targeted for a Q3 go-live and expected to be available for use in Q4. At present, the team is coordinating with various upstream systems to establish connectivity with the canary pre-prod environment.

We also discussed the existing challenges:
	•	TPAM needs to be raised for every request (bi-weekly, sprint-wise, or deployment-only).
	•	Limited access for the development team.
	•	Separate TPAMs required for enhanced permissions.
	•	However, the canary environment will offer advantages such as closer alignment with production in terms of both database and code base.

I’ve included the lead and schema details in this mail. The related requirement ID has been raised and is currently in progress.

Please let me know if you need any further details.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
