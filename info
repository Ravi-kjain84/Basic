Thanks for your message.

While we initially focused on test case preparation, we are now looking to evaluate the solution across the full Finance Transformation change lifecycle—from requirement gathering (e.g., user story generation, process flows) to deployment. As part of this, we plan to involve various value streams in the pilot to ensure broader coverage. We’re also exploring use cases across project and portfolio management, such as SCRUM tracking, RAID management, and delivery reporting.

Happy to discuss further if needed.

Let me know if you’d like to tailor it further for a specific audience or stakeholder.
