Subject: Request for Discussion on Alteryx for Regression Dashboard Automation (POC)

Dear [Recipient’s Name],

I hope you are doing well.

During a recent discussion with Jitendra, the use of Alteryx for EUC automation was mentioned. It prompted me to explore its potential value in the context of regression dashboard automation from a testing perspective.

I believe it would be worthwhile to discuss this further, particularly to understand your views and the logistics involved—such as the process for obtaining access or raising a license request for a potential POC.

Would you be open to a quick connect on this? I can schedule a meeting based on our mutual availability.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Ravi Jayant
Testing CoE Lead
