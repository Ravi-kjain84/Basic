Subject: GenAI Test Case POC – Progress Update

Dear Roshan and Team,

A quick update on the GenAI-based test case generation POC.

We have received access to the Alice environment and are now able to generate test cases based on available requirements. While still at an early stage, the initial outputs have shown practical value. We are currently reviewing these test cases with the testing team to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.

In parallel, we are engaging with the Treasury IT and IWPB teams, who are working on similar use cases. The IWPB team has granted us temporary access to their pilot solution, which integrates with Jira and effectively addresses several of our requirements. They also plan to enhance it further to parse additional documents, such as policy guidelines, to enrich the output. A follow-up discussion with their team is scheduled for tomorrow to explore potential collaboration.

As we progress, we are also considering the necessary controls and governance required to embed this capability into the future-state operating model.

Will share further updates after tomorrow’s discussion.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
