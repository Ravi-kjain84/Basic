Subject: Alignment on Productivity Suite and Orchestration Use Case

Hi Nathan,

Good to see the use cases you’re progressing. As Kiran mentioned, we’d like to join forces on this. To share some context — we’re currently running a POC on the orchestration use case that begins from requirement creation and extends through writing use cases, Jira stories, and test cases.

Around 37 nominees from various value streams have participated in the Productivity Suite POC so far. We’ve also extended it for a smaller group to include and compare solutions designed by WPB, CIB, and the Productivity Suite. The next phase will explore low-level design document generation using ADV functionality.

To align our efforts and walkthroughs, I’ll set up a short call with you, Luke, Jack, Kiran, and me to review what’s in progress from both sides.

Best,
Ravi

Would you like me to make it slightly more formal (for leadership copy) or keep it in this collaborative tone?
