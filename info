Subject: RE: GenAI Test Writing Use Cases

Hi Kiran,

I’ve included you as an optional attendee in the invite to keep you in the loop.

There is a team in Treasury IT currently working on GenAI-based test case generation using the Cucumber methodology. Their work aligns well with our objectives, and there may be an opportunity to collaborate with them for our use case.

If the alignment continues, there’s strong potential to converge all three streams — IWBP, Treasury IT, and our initiative — into a common solution.

Best regards,
Ravi Kumar Jain
