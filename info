Subject: RE: Request for one GitHub Copilot Access for Testing CoE Initiatives

Hi Ruchan,

At this stage, I’m requesting approval for a single user access—only for myself. This will help me go through the approval process once, understand any dependencies or nuances, and then streamline it for others when we expand further.

The approval process is tightly controlled by IT, and this request will only cover the initial step (up to 4d). Subsequent steps will follow once the process is validated.

Please find the Co-pilot Access Request Process details below for reference.

Would you like me to make a version that sounds slightly more assertive (as in, “I recommend proceeding with my individual access first to validate the process”) — useful if you’re sending this as a follow-up to prompt approval?
