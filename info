Subject: Re: Project Equinox: Test Strategy and AI Use cases

Hi Rachel,

Thank you for your note. The IWPB initiative is separate from the Tailwind (CIB) initiative. We had previously connected with the IWPB team from a Testing use case perspective. However, they have other use cases as well, which are comparable to Tailwind. The Tailwind team has confirmed readiness to share up to 20 licenses for Finance team reviews, whereas the IWPB team could only provide two licenses to start with (one for Testing and one for Treasury IT). We are also trying to secure more licenses from the IWPB team.

As of now, we have requested Ravi’s access from a Testing perspective for IWPB. He will also be receiving access for Tailwind, which will allow him to compare both solutions. Once access is available, we can set up a call to demo the key differences and the pros and cons of both solutions. If we cannot get more licenses from the IWPB team, this call will ensure everyone can see the comparison.

Thanks & Regards,
Kiran Pisapati

Would you like me to make the last paragraph one line shorter for a sharper finish?
