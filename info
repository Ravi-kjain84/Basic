Subject: Follow-up on Testing Team Concerns Discussed Yesterday

Hi [Colleague’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well.

I wanted to follow up on the discussion we had yesterday regarding the challenges your team is currently facing. To summarize:
	1.	UAT Sign-off Delays: We discussed that final users are often too busy to provide timely sign-offs, leading to delays in the UAT process.
	2.	Agile Ceremonies: With the adoption of Agile, the team is finding that ceremonies are consuming a significant portion of their time, leaving less room for actual testing activities.
	3.	Frequent Resource Changes: The team is experiencing frequent turnover, which means new resources often need to be retrained, affecting both the efficiency and quality of the testing process.

Let’s collaborate on potential solutions for these issues. I’m confident we can streamline the UAT process, optimize the Agile ceremonies to free up more testing time, and establish a more stable resource training plan.

Please let me know a good time for us to discuss these solutions further.

Best regards,
Ravi
