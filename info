Subject: Gurgaon Visit Itinerary (Complete)

Hi Kiran,

Please find attached the complete itinerary for 15–17 July. It includes all meeting details.

There’s just one 15-minute overlap on 17 July (11:30–11:45). If possible, please consider adjusting that slot, as no other time is available for that group.

Hope this covers everything — let me know if anything needs to be updated.

Best regards,
