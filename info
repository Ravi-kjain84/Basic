Subject: GenAI Solution for Test Case Generation – Request for Demo and Collaboration

Hi Adonis, Charlie, and Alka,

We are currently working on a Generative AI solution aimed at automating test case generation. While the results so far are promising, the effectiveness of the solution depends heavily on the clarity and quality of requirement writing. We believe there is strong potential to further enhance both the solution and the upstream process.

I would like to walk you through a quick demo to show how the GenAI solution is supporting us—particularly in generating the first draft of test cases—and explore how we can collaborate to improve the end-to-end process.

Please let me know if I can set up a time for the walkthrough and to gather your valuable input.

Best regards,
Ravi
Testing Center of Excellence Lead

Let me know if you’d like to add a proposed time slot or attach a brief summary before the demo.
