Let me walk through it as if I were the recipient.

Your mail is already clear, polite, and structured. A few small tweaks could make it flow smoother and sound more natural in a corporate setting:
	1.	Sentence tightening — “On the point regarding public and internal data…” is slightly formal and heavy. You can say “Regarding data usage…” for simplicity.
	2.	Consistency — You wrote “public or internal policy document references,” which is fine, but “policy documents (public or internal)” sounds cleaner.
	3.	Ending — “Thank you again, and we look forward…” works well, but if you want a crisper close: “We appreciate your support and look forward to our discussion next week.”

Here’s the refined version with those small changes:

Subject: RE: AI Governance Request RITM36835353 has been Approved

Hi Anubhav,

Thank you for the update. As suggested, I have filled the form and submitted it.

Regarding data usage, we are restricting the PoC to internal data only. The value stream leads have been instructed not to use any finance data or sensitive information. The value streams will be using policy documents (public or internal) to initiate the process and generate the subsequent delivery artifacts.

This week, we have aligned the value streams with the required expectations and are now looking forward to providing them the necessary accesses so they can proceed with the PoC at their end.

We appreciate your support and look forward to our discussion next week.

Thanks and regards,
Ravi

This version keeps your intent intact, just smoother to read. Want me to also make a shorter 3-paragraph version in case you’d like it to be more executive-style (less detail, faster to scan)?
