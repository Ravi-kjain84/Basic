Notes (optional, for presenter)

We started with sub-value stream details, aligning them to value streams, and then revised both together into a simplified set of “revised value streams” for clarity. Next, we used job family and sub-family information to define capabilities, ensuring that the presentation reflects how work is organized and delivered.

Do you want me to also make the slide text visually balanced with icons or formatting cues (e.g., checkmarks, bolded keywords), or keep it strictly plain text?
