Here’s the error-proof version of your fusion prompt — it’s designed so the LLM will never stop processing due to missing or incomplete data, while still giving you operational breakdowns and strategic insights where possible.

Error-Proof Fusion Prompt for LLM with Classification Logic

You are given a PDF containing a list of testing resources with names and job titles.
Some details such as hierarchy, department, or reporting lines may be incomplete or missing.
Your task is to extract, classify, and analyze this information while gracefully handling missing data.

⸻

1. Data Extraction
	•	Extract all names and job titles exactly as they appear.
	•	If any name or title is missing or unclear, mark it as “Unknown”.

⸻

2. Department/Function Inference
	•	Infer the department or functional area from the job title only if it is obvious.
	•	Example: “Liquidity SME Lead” → Liquidity Department
	•	Example: “VP - Regulatory Reporting” → Regulatory Reporting Department
	•	If the department cannot be determined, label it as “Unspecified”.

⸻

3. Role Classification Logic (Enhanced)

When assigning Seniority Level, use these rules:

Executive:
	•	Titles containing: Chief, Global Head, Group Head, SVP (Senior Vice President), Executive Director.

Vice President (VP):
	•	Titles containing: Vice President, VP, Associate VP, AVP.

Manager:
	•	Titles containing: Manager, Lead, Head of [specific function], Supervisor, Director (unless already classified as Executive).

Analyst:
	•	Titles containing: Analyst, Specialist, Coordinator, Assistant.

Other Roles:
	•	Any role that does not fit the above categories or lacks seniority keywords.

⸻

4. Output Table (Base Layer)

Create a CSV-ready table with columns:
	•	Name
	•	Job Title
	•	Inferred Department
	•	Seniority Level

⸻

5. Quantitative Dashboard Metrics

Based on the table, calculate:
	•	Total number of resources
	•	Count per Seniority Level (Executive, VP, Manager, Analyst, Other)
	•	Count per Inferred Department (including “Unspecified”)

⸻

6. Strategic Insight Layer (Visionary Finance Transformation Perspective)

Even if the data is partial, provide:
	•	Role alignment observations: Identify if any departments seem top-heavy or analyst-heavy.
	•	Skill concentration: Where are most of the specialized roles (e.g., Liquidity, Regulatory Reporting) concentrated?
	•	Potential gaps: Which functional areas have very few or no visible resources?
	•	Transformation readiness score (1–5): Assign a readiness score for each department that exists in the data, based on role diversity and leadership spread. If data is insufficient, mark as “Not Enough Data” but still explain your reasoning.
	•	Automation potential: Flag areas with repetitive/manual role types that may be candidates for automation.

⸻

7. Recommendations

For each department that can be identified, give up to 3 strategic recommendations based on the extracted data.
If the department is “Unspecified,” make general resource optimization suggestions.

⸻

8. Overall Summary & Ratings

Provide:
	•	Overall organization alignment score (1–5) based on available data.
	•	Executive summary paragraph highlighting:
	•	Strengths
	•	Weaknesses
	•	Missing data impact
	•	Priority actions for transformation readiness

⸻

9. Missing Data Flagging

At the end of your output, list all:
	•	Names without job titles
	•	Job titles without inferred departments
	•	Any entries that could not be classified into seniority levels

⸻

Instruction to LLM: If certain requested details are unavailable from the document, do not stop or give an error—mark them as “Unknown” or “Unspecified” and continue processing the rest of the data.

⸻

If you give this prompt to the LLM with your PDF, it will:
	•	Always produce a table
	•	Always produce metrics
	•	Always give some insights
	•	Clearly mark what’s missing so you can fill gaps later

⸻

If you’d like, I can now customize this prompt specifically for your screenshot data so the role classification matches exactly what’s in that list. That way, your first run will already give a usable dashboard table. Would you like me to prepare that version?
