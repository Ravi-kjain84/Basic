Subject: RE: Request for AI Benefit Estimate Review – AI Use Case Pack for FAMM

Hi Ruchan,

I completely agree — this requires a thorough discussion to look at applicability across programmes, activities, and roles, and to check for overlaps with benefits already captured in our existing commitments. This will help ensure we isolate the true AI-specific benefits and assess them objectively.

A deeper review will also allow us to clearly define the denominator, validate the approach taken by IWPB, and establish realistic savings and delivery timelines. I will work with Kiran to prepare an initial draft covering these aspects, and then we can set up a joint session to review and refine it before moving forward.

Next steps:
	•	Work with Kiran to prepare the first draft of the proposal addressing applicability across different programmes, activities, and roles.
	•	Analyse overlaps with current commitments to separate AI-driven benefits.
	•	Define the denominator and review the IWPB approach for alignment.
	•	Agree on savings and delivery timelines based on the deep-dive findings.
	•	Update Piyush that we are proceeding with internal discussions and will revert with the revised business plan and benefit estimates.

Regards,
Ravi Kumar Jain

This keeps the tone collaborative, explains the reasoning, and still gives a structured next-step list for clarity.

If you want, I can also make a version that integrates the next steps into the body so it reads as a natural narrative instead of a bullet list. That can make it flow more like a conversation than a project update.
