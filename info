Here’s the feature list for Variants Analysis – Submission & Output checks, written in the same simple bullet format:
	•	Variance metrics calculation – after clicking Submit Dimensions & Filters, verify correct calculation and display of:
	•	Count percentage variance
	•	RW Post percentage variance
	•	OE percentage variance
	•	EAD percentage variance
	•	EL UST percentage variance
	•	Duplicate rows percentage variance
	•	Batch ID validation – confirm the variance analysis uses the exact batch IDs selected from the left-side bar.
	•	Categorical columns display – ensure all categorical columns chosen as dimensions appear in the output.
	•	Numerical columns display – ensure all numerical columns selected in the query appear in the output.
	•	Sorting option – check that the user can sort on any of the selected columns.
	•	Value formatting – confirm all numeric values are displayed up to two decimal places only.
	•	Grouping correctness – verify no duplicate rows exist at the categorical level; amounts and numbers must be grouped by the combination of all selected columns.

Want me to now combine all three sections (Data Guard v3, Variants Analysis – Dimensions/Filters, Variants Analysis – Submission/Output) into a single master feature checklist so you can use it as your baseline testing scope?
