Subject: Meeting Request: Connect with Kiran Pisapati (Head of Finance Transformation CoE)

Hi Dimple,

Hope you’re doing well.

Kiran Pisapati, who recently joined as the Head of Finance Transformation CoE, will be visiting the Gurugram office between 15th and 17th July. He is keen to connect with colleagues driving key initiatives.

At Kiran’s suggestion, I’m reaching out to schedule a brief connect between you and him. I’ll propose a few time slots shortly based on your availability.

Please do let me know if you have any constraints or would prefer an alternative arrangement.

Regards,
Ravi Kumar Jain
