Possible Questions from Participants:
	1.	Why are we included in this discussion when we’re not involved in testing activities?
	2.	What is the current stage of the GenAI initiative?
	3.	Can we get access to the GenAI environment or tool?
	4.	How feasible is it to identify reusable test cases when most of our scenarios are unique?
	5.	We already have automation—how is this different or better?
	6.	The proposed solutions don’t seem applicable to our use cases—can we reassess relevance?
	7.	Given existing timelines, do we have capacity to support this initiative right now?
