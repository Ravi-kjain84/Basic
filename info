Subject: Request for Nominations – GenAI Pilot Participation for Finance Transformation

Dear Value Stream Leads,

As part of our innovation agenda within Finance Transformation, we are collaborating with the Tailwind team on a Generative AI (GenAI) Pilot initiative scheduled for go-live in August.

This pilot introduces AI-driven tools aimed at automating and enhancing core activities such as user story creation, UAT test script generation, BRD development, RAID clarity, and investment case validation. The initiative is designed to drive efficiency and reduce manual overhead across delivery functions.

We have been invited to nominate a limited number of users from Finance Transformation to participate in this pilot. These users will gain early access to the GenAI tools and contribute to evaluating their applicability across our value streams.

Action Required:
Please share names of interested users from your respective value streams by [insert date, e.g., 2 August 2025].

Should you have any questions or need additional context, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
Head of Finance Transformation
