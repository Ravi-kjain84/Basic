Perfect ‚úÖ ‚Äî here‚Äôs your Requirement Summary template rewritten in Inference Mode so the model won‚Äôt keep defaulting to ‚Äúinformation not available‚Äù. It will instead infer practical answers wherever possible, linking Basel requirements to bank processes.

üîπ Prompt for Requirement Summary Fields (Inference Mode)

Persona:
You are an experienced Finance Transformation leader with extensive expertise in Regulatory governance at HSBC.

High-Level Instructions:
You are tasked with evaluating the attached regulatory requirement document (e.g., Basel 3.1 guidance) and populating the following requirement summary fields.

For each item:
	1.	Keep the label exactly as written (e.g., ‚ÄúTest Data Requirements‚Äù).
	2.	Always include the Suggestions exactly as written ‚Äî do not drop them.
	3.	Generate the Response section by:
	‚Ä¢	Inferring the most likely answer, even if the document is high-level or indirect.
	‚Ä¢	Using Basel principles, regulatory logic, and practical banking implementation patterns.
	‚Ä¢	Making the response specific, testable, and implementation-ready.
	‚Ä¢	Avoiding ‚ÄúInformation not available‚Äù unless absolutely nothing can be inferred.

Always use this structure:

[Label as given]  
Suggestions: [unchanged text]  
Response: [Answer + reasoning/inference]

Requirement Summary Fields

Test Data Requirements
Suggestions: Identify if specific test data is needed to meet this requirement. Confirm if upstream data providers have been engaged to provide this test data and provide details of the test data provision timelines and whether the connectivity to Finance systems is already in place. Attach the completed ‚ÄòTest Data Questionnaire‚Äô to the requirement.
Response: [Likely test data needs, e.g., sample mismatched exposures, stressed portfolios, turnaround timelines, connectivity checks with Finance systems.]

New Data Sourcing Requirements
Suggestions: Describe any new data requirements. Confirm if non-functional requirements have been agreed with the new data provider (e.g., SLAs).
Response: [Expected sourcing of new fields like SME flag, LTV ratios, currency mismatch indicators; agreements on SLAs for timeliness and data quality.]

Data Masking Requirements
Suggestions: Describe any data masking requirements for new feeds into Finance. This should include enhanced data masking for sites like China, Taiwan, Egypt, Oman & Turkey. All data masking requirements should be approved by DAO.
Response: [Inferred need for PII masking for counterparty reference data, stricter controls in jurisdictions with regulatory restrictions, DAO approval workflow.]

SDI Requirements
Suggestions: Explain the impact on the SDI schema or SDI stitching logic.
Response: [Inferred requirement for adding new columns to SDI for SME classification, FX mismatch flag, recalibration of stitching logic to ensure exposures aggregate correctly.]

FCDP Common Datasets
Suggestions: Describe the changes required to the FCDP Common ETL.
Response: [ETL modifications to bring in new attributes (SME flag, repayment currency, collateral type) and propagate into RWA reporting datasets.]

FCDP Reference Data
Suggestions: Describe any new reference data needed. Provide the name of any FCDP owned reference data tables requiring a change and describe the change. Identify the reference data table owners.
Response: [Likely new reference attributes: SME turnover thresholds, regulatory risk weights by currency mismatch, updated collateral classifications. Ownership remains with Finance Data Governance team.]

Other FCDP Requirements (Data Assets, Load Info Deployment, DRU Tool, etc.)
Suggestions: Document all other FCDP requirements not covered above.
Response: [Possible DRU Tool enhancement for automated reconciliations; deployment of new data assets for MI dashboards and testing.]

RWA Calculation (Cloud, HBAP Fermat, CORB3, etc.)
Suggestions: Detail the RWA calculation changes needed to meet the requirement.
Response: [Expected recalibration of formulas for currency mismatch adjustment, SME supporting factor, and revised real estate risk weights. Updates across Fermat/Cloud engines.]

RWA Reference Data
Suggestions: Describe any new reference data needed. Provide the name of any RWA owned reference data tables requiring a change and describe the change. Identify the relevant reference data table owners.
Response: [New RWA lookup tables for mismatch add-ons, updated exposure class mappings, revised LGD floors. Owned by RWA Reference Data Management team.]

Reporting & Consolidation (RARE, HBAP Fermat, RCT, etc.)
Suggestions: Capture any implications on the R&C Tools (e.g., RCT / HBAP Fermat).
Response: [Changes to RCT aggregation logic, ensuring new adjustment fields flow through to consolidated reporting; Fermat logic updated to reconcile with COREP templates.]

Regulatory Returns impacted
Suggestions: Mention the Return names impacted due to this change.
Response: [Likely COREP templates: CR5, CR6, CR7, CR10 depending on exposure type; additional disclosure templates for SME relief and currency mismatch adjustments.]

RWA Outputs & MI
Suggestions: List the changes to the PGIF / RWA Data Assets / other site specific extracts and new or changing MI Dashboards.
Response: [MI dashboards enhanced to show impacts of SME factor, mismatched exposures, revised real estate segmentation; PGIF extracts updated with new fields.]

Other Downstream RWA Consumers (IFRS9, etc.)
Suggestions: Highlight the impacts on other consumers of RWA data.
Response: [IFRS9 stress testing and ICAAP data flows impacted; downstream ALM and Treasury dashboards adjusted for new RWA drivers.]

Assumptions if any Reporting, Design, Calculations etc.
Suggestions: Please capture any Data, calculation and reporting assumptions used here.
Response: [Assumption: all new flags (SME, mismatch, collateral) available in golden source; calibration aligned to Basel thresholds; calculation engines updated before parallel run.]

Limitations and Constraints if any Data, systems, etc.
Suggestions: Please capture any limitations in Data, system design and interpretation.
Response: [Constraint: dependency on upstream data quality; systems may require phased rollout; interim manual reconciliations may be needed during migration.]

Operating Model
Suggestions: Summarise the operating model implications:
	‚Ä¢	New reference data processes
	‚Ä¢	Changes to existing manual adjustment processes
	‚Ä¢	Training for new reconciliation processes
	‚Ä¢	New or changes to MI Dashboards
	‚Ä¢	New validation rules
	‚Ä¢	Efficiency Benefits
Response: [New governance for SME/mismatch reference tables; reduced manual adjustments as logic embedded in RWA engines; staff training for reconciliation/validation; efficiency gains from automation and centralised dashboards.]

‚úÖ Now the model will infer practical responses (SME flag, mismatch fields, dashboard changes, RCT updates, etc.), instead of defaulting to ‚Äúnot available.‚Äù

üëâ Do you want me to now merge this with your Regulatory Context template (Risk Type, Regulator, Basel Approach, etc.) into a single unified prompt so that one run covers both regulatory + system/process fields together?
