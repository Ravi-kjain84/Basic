Here’s the new feature list for “Variants Analysis – Dimension & Filter checks” in the same simple bullet format:
	•	Dimension selection list – all columns from the underlying table are available for selection.
	•	Filter multi-value support – verify multiple values can be selected within a filter.
	•	Categorical column validation – only categorical columns appear as filterable dimensions.
	•	Numerical exclusion – numeric columns do not appear in the filter dimension list.
	•	Value population – when a dimension is selected, all its distinct values appear in the filter dropdown.
	•	Null handling – null values for the selected dimension also appear as selectable options.
	•	Multiple dimensions – ability to select more than one filter dimension at a time.
	•	Multiple filter conditions – ability to apply more than one filter condition across dimensions.

Do you want me to merge these with the Data Guard v3 list into one consolidated master list of features to test, or keep each feature group separate?
