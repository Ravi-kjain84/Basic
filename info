Subject: Request for Nominations – Participation in GenAI Pilot for Finance Transformation

Dear Value Stream Leads,

As part of our ongoing commitment to innovation within Finance Transformation, we are collaborating with the Tailwind team on their Generative AI (GenAI) Pilot initiative, which is scheduled to go live in August.

This pilot introduces a suite of AI-driven tools aimed at streamlining key tasks such as user story creation, UAT test script generation, BRD development, RAID clarity, and investment case validation. These use cases are designed to enhance efficiency, reduce manual effort, and accelerate delivery timelines across business analysis, clarity, and control monitoring functions.

We have been invited to nominate a select number of users from Finance Transformation to actively participate in this pilot. These participants will gain early access to the tools and play a key role in validating their effectiveness across our value streams.

Request:
Please share the names of interested users from your respective value streams who would benefit from participating in this pilot. We are aiming to collate a list of up to 20 users across the portfolio. Kindly ensure that the nominated users are familiar with our core documentation processes and actively contribute to BAU and project initiatives.

Deadline:
Please send your nominations by [insert date, e.g., 2 August 2025] to help us finalize the participant list and ensure timely onboarding.

Should you have any queries or require further context, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
Head of Finance Transformation
