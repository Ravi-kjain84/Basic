One-Slide Project Plan (Executive View)

Generative AI for Change Management Orchestration – 6-Month Plan
	•	Month 1: Mobilization
• Value streams nominated participants
• Access to HSBC Productivity Suite, CIB, IWPB arranged
• Kick-off call to align and consolidate requirements
	•	Month 2: Prompt Development
• Provide sample prompt templates
• Nominees draft prompts for requirement templates, HLD, epics, test cases
	•	Month 3: Artifact Creation & Review
• Generate requirements & design artifacts from prompts
• Refine prompts iteratively
• Peer reviews of generated outputs
	•	Month 4: Evaluation
• Apply evaluation metrics to outputs
• Compare across HSBC Suite, CIB, IWPB solutions
• Shortlist preferred solution
	•	Month 5: Phase 2 – Contextualization
• Build knowledge repository (prior requirements, data dictionary, lineage)
• Re-run POC with added context
• Collaborate with AI Group / IWPB IT Pod
	•	Month 6: Phase 3 – Extension
• Low-level design docs with lineage
• Pilot automation of regulatory reporting preparation
• Plan scale-up roadmap

Detailed End-to-End Plan

Phase 1 – Foundation (Months 1–3)
	•	Mobilization (M1)
	•	Collect nominees from each value stream.
	•	Provide HSBC Productivity Suite, CIB, and IWPB accesses.
	•	Kick-off call to centralize requirement submission.
	•	Share sample prompt templates.
	•	Prompting & Artifacts (M2–M3)
	•	Nominees craft prompts for: requirement templates, HLDs, epics, test cases.
	•	Generate artifacts, refine prompts iteratively.
	•	Peer review sessions for quality and completeness.

Phase 2 – Evaluation & Contextualization (Months 4–5)
	•	Evaluation (M4)
	•	Apply evaluation metrics (accuracy, completeness, usability, efficiency).
	•	Identify strengths/weaknesses of HSBC Suite, CIB, IWPB outputs.
	•	Shortlist preferred solution for Phase 2 build-out.
	•	Contextualization (M5)
	•	Build internal knowledge repository with:
• historical requirements
• data dictionary
• data lineage context
	•	Collaborate with AI Group / IWPB pod for enhanced solution.
	•	Conduct POC round-2 with contextual augmentation.

Phase 3 – Extension & Automation (Month 6)
	•	Develop low-level design documents incorporating lineage.
	•	Explore automation of regulatory reporting preparation.
	•	Engage architects & IT team for scale-up design.
	•	Final evaluation: feasibility for full deployment and long-term roadmap.

Would you like me to prepare the slide itself (PowerPoint/PDF, ready to present) with the executive version formatted cleanly, or do you just need the text structured so you can paste it into your template?
