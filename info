Subject: Quick Connect on Alteryx for Regression Dashboard Automation

Hi [Recipient’s Name],

While speaking with Jitendra, I came across the use of Alteryx for EUC automation. I feel it could be useful to explore Alteryx for automating our regression dashboard from a testing perspective as well.

Would you be open to a quick connect to share your thoughts on this? I’d also like to understand the process for trying it out—like how to raise a license request or any other logistics needed for a POC.

Please let me know if you’re okay to connect, and I’ll set up a meeting as per our availability.

Thanks,
Ravi
