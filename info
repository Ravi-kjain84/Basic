Req ID should be dynamically extracted from the requirement section displayed in the top-right corner. Specifically, take the Req ID from the line that starts with: "Summary of REQ-xxxx". For example, if it says "Summary of REQ-4884", then Req ID should be REQ-4884. Do not use REQ-4577 â€” it is only an illustration.
