Here’s a rephrased version of the Overview as a Problem Statement and Opportunity:

⸻

Problem Statement
The current project delivery management process in IWBP GTC Transformation is heavily manual, requiring substantial effort across scoping, requirement gathering, planning, governance, and documentation. This results in extended delivery timelines, inconsistent quality of outputs, and significant reliance on subject matter experts. The lack of automation also limits scalability, making it difficult to handle increased workloads or adapt quickly to new change requests.

Opportunity
By integrating HSBC-contextualised GenAI solutions into the delivery process, there is an opportunity to automate critical activities across the delivery lifecycle. AI-enabled tools can streamline requirement capture, enhance planning efficiency, and improve governance and documentation quality. This will:
	•	Increase productivity and scalability, enabling the team to manage larger workloads with existing resources.
	•	Reduce manual workload, freeing SMEs and delivery teams for higher-value activities.
	•	Enhance output quality and speed, accelerating change delivery and improving stakeholder satisfaction.

Do you want me to now also adapt this into the Expected Solution / Outcome format for your PoC Proposal slide so it flows directly from the problem statement?
