Subject: RE: Gen AI & Automation demo: Testing CoE Priorities and Targets

Hi Dishan, Hi Shubha,

Thanks for your messages and for sharing the current status on the F4 delivery.

I understand that the team is in a critical phase with UAT and putting in long hours. I’m fine with reviewing the Testing CoE KPIs for F4 after UAT—sometime in October or November as suggested.

That said, if the team is working 12–14 hours a day, we should try to support them earlier where possible. If someone can walk me through the current testing or governance process, I’d be happy to see if there’s any quick automation or process fix we can apply in the short term.

Also, just to confirm—we’re open to reviewing the KPIs on a case-by-case basis depending on the specific needs of each project.

Happy to connect if a quick discussion helps.

Best regards,
Ravi
