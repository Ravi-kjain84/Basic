Certainly, Ravi. Here’s a concise and professionally worded version of your slide titled:

⸻

✅ Future State Architecture of Testing
	•	Testing team embedded within Agile squads, working in 2–4 week sprints
	•	GenAI generates initial test cases once sprint requirements are finalized
	•	Test cases reviewed against guidelines to confirm acceptance criteria
	•	Automated and manual tests executed in parallel
	•	Results validated by Product Owner and end users

Early involvement of end users ensures better defect detection and test coverage.

⸻

🔍 Key Improvements:
	•	Reduced word count by ~30%
	•	Removed repetition (“testing”, “team”, “will”, etc.) while keeping intent intact
	•	Used consistent and formal phrasing

Let me know if you’d like this version reflected in a PowerPoint or email summary.
