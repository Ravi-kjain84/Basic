Hi Simar / Deba,

Thank you for your time and the insightful demo yesterday.

Here are the key points we discussed:
	•	The current use case for Finance/Treasury IT primarily revolves around Test Case generation; however, there could be additional opportunities to collaborate on other IWPB use cases related to Transformation tasks.
	•	Deba provided a comprehensive overview of the flow, covering from requirements/JIRA connectivity through to future potential using Agentic AI for end-to-end transformation.

Next Steps:
	•	We look forward to receiving a high-level document that provides additional clarity on the current use cases and their progress.
	•	Further discussions on collaboration opportunities and defining the way forward.

Additionally, I am looping in @Piyush GUPTA (Global Head of Innovation and Strategic Projects), who is supporting us in onboarding this use case and ensuring proper governance. Also including @Alec PRINGLE and @Sebastien BENISTANT from the Treasury IT team, as they are involved in similar PoC efforts on Test Case generation.

Looking forward to our next discussion. Could you please suggest a convenient time for this?

Best regards,
