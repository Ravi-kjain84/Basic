Subject: Discussion on Testing Approach for Abacus Project

Hi Krishesh,

I’m currently acting as the Testing COE Lead for Finance Transformation, responsible for defining testing strategy and driving improvements across value streams.

To give some context — Vikram Sarma had earlier discussed a requirement for a testing lead for the Abacus project, but in our recent conversation he mentioned that a local resource has now been identified as the test lead. As one of the outcomes of that discussion, it would be helpful for us to connect to understand the current testing approach for Abacus and explore opportunities to apply the best practices, automation initiatives, and use of GenAI recommended by the Testing COE.

Please let me know a convenient time this week for a brief discussion.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Testing COE Lead – Finance Transformation
