Subject: Discussion Points for Meeting with Vikram Sharma

Hi Kiran,

Ahead of our discussion with Vikram Sharma today, I’ve noted a few points for your review. Please suggest if these look fine or if we should align on them before the call.
	1.	Considering I’ll be taking up the Testing Lead role for this project (in addition to my COE responsibilities), we can plan a knowledge transfer from the current testing team to me to understand the scope and nature of testing activities.
	2.	I should begin getting system accesses early to familiarize myself with the tools and environments used in the project.
	3.	We may agree on a travel plan (China or UK) to connect with the team, understand the workflow, and establish coordination on-site.
	4.	We should review whether the current testing team alignment can move under the COE for improved governance, consistency, and control over deliverables.
	5.	Need to confirm timeline for major testing events — my understanding is that they begin around February.
	6.	I should start joining the ongoing project calls to stay current on activities and dependencies.
	7.	Please note, I’ll be on leave during the week of 20th October, and can start engaging more closely from the last week of October.
	8.	We should clarify billing arrangements for this new role — whether it requires an FRP, and how the chargeback to the project will be managed. This would also help us track resource redeployment and efficiency gains from the COE perspective.

Please share your thoughts or any refinements before the meeting.

Best regards,
Ravi

Would you like it to sound slightly more formal (for onward sharing with Vikram later) or keep this internal tone for Kiran only?
