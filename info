Got it — let’s refine the Kick-off to also reflect the access updates. Here’s the adjusted sequence:

⸻

Pre-PoC Preparation

Kick-off → Plan shared, evaluation criteria explained, expectations set, access status updated

⸻

Week 1

Checkpoint 1 → Requirements identified, access confirmed, accountabilities set
Checkpoint 2 → Prompts designed, initial prompts tested, first outputs generated
Checkpoint 3 → Early observations captured

⸻

Week 2

Checkpoint 4 → Feedback reviewed, refinements made
Checkpoint 5 → Interim results consolidated, templates populated
Checkpoint 6 → Final outcomes compiled, submission pack ready

⸻

Would you like me to now drop these final checkpoint texts into your timeline slide (PPT) so you have a polished version ready to present?
