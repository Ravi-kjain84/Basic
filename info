Subject: Guidance on Interlock with Project Equinox

Hi Kiran,

Hope you’re doing well.

I wanted to check in regarding the connection between our AI and testing work and the broader activities under Project Equinox, which Sarfaraz is leading.

Sarfaraz has begun asking for regular updates from our side to be shared in the weekly Equinox forum, and he also set up a separate sync-up ahead of today’s forum call. While we’re happy to collaborate, it’s becoming important to clearly understand how closely our work is expected to align with Equinox, and where the boundaries should lie.

Rushan had also asked us to assess and clarify the level of interlock between the two streams, so we’d like to get your advice before formally aligning any deliverables or update structure.

Would appreciate your guidance on:
	•	What level of interlock is expected between our work and Equinox?
	•	How best to ensure alignment without losing clarity of ownership?

Thanks in advance for your support.

Best regards,
Ravi

Let me know if you’d like a variant with a proposed next step or if this should be copied to Sarfaraz as well.

Subject: Discussion on AI and Automation Opportunities

Hi Trystan,

Hope you’re doing well.

To quickly introduce myself — I’m Ravi Jain, currently acting as the Testing Centre of Excellence Lead within Finance Transformation, supporting various value streams across the finance functions.

Kiran mentioned that your team has been exploring options for EUC remediation and had reached out regarding Alteryx. As part of our ongoing efforts, we’re also evaluating a range of AI and automation opportunities that may be relevant in this space.

I’d be happy to connect to understand your current requirements in more detail and explore where these solutions might add value. Please let me know a convenient time for a brief discussion this week or early next.

Looking forward to the conversation.

Best regards,
Ravi

Subject: Access Request for AI Evaluation on IWPB

Hi Piyush,

As Simar hasn’t raised any objection to the use case I shared earlier, I think we can go ahead and raise the request to the Finance Governance team for around 5% access (approx. 100 users) to support the AI evaluation on IWPB — if not already done.

Thanks,
Ravi
