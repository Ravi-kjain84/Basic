Here’s the feature list for Variant Sample Table & True Match checks, simplified into clear bullet points:

Variant Sample Table
	•	Gap details display – sample table should show all the gaps with full details.
	•	Row drill-down – clicking on a sample account row should display details from the account or deal ID.
	•	Column selection option – user should be able to pick columns from the RWRP output table to show in the sample accounts with variances.
	•	Minimum rows – at least 10 rows of sample accounts should be displayed.
	•	Save commentary – ability to enter commentary for a row and save it.
	•	Save commentary behavior – verify what happens after saving (e.g., persists in DB, shows confirmation, reloads).
	•	True Match button presence – confirm a True Match button exists on the screen.
	•	True Match button action – clicking the button opens a new window with both dataset IDs and the project pre-selected.

True Match
	•	Project, dataset, and table entry – user can enter/select Project IDs, Dataset IDs, and randomly chosen table names from a list.
	•	Composite key validation – verify that selected comparison keys are genuine composite keys.
	•	Row count comparison – for selected tables, check row count comparison works.
	•	Unique row count comparison – verify unique row count by composite key matches the expected unique rows.

Do you want me to now merge everything so far (Data Guard v3 + Variants Analysis + Sample Table + True Match) into one consolidated checklist?
