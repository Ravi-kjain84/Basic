Good eye — both points are spot on:
	1.	Word count: Yes, we can tighten even more by dropping helper words (“are,” “set,” “explained”) and focusing on action verbs + outcomes.
	2.	Tense: Switching to active voice makes it sharper and more directive (good for checkpoints).

Here’s a tightened version of your AI PoC Plan:

⸻

Pre-PoC Preparation

Kick-off → Share plan, explain criteria, set expectations, update access status

⸻

Week 1

Checkpoint 1 → Identify requirements, confirm access, assign accountabilities
Checkpoint 2 → Design prompts, test initial ones, generate first outputs
Checkpoint 3 → Capture early observations

⸻

Week 2

Checkpoint 4 → Review feedback, refine outputs
Checkpoint 5 → Consolidate interim results, populate templates
Checkpoint 6 → Compile final outcomes, prepare submission pack

⸻

You’ll notice:
	•	All verbs are now active (“share,” “identify,” “design,” “capture,” “review,” “compile”).
	•	Fewer filler words — it’s 20–25% shorter overall.
	•	Each checkpoint is a crisp milestone instead of a descriptive sentence.

Would you like me to also reformat your current PPT file with this reduced/active text so you can see the before-and-after difference visually?
