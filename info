Got it — here’s the simple bullet-point list of features to be tested for Data Guard v3 based on what you described:
	•	Jira token selection (JRoken panel) – correct token is picked.
	•	Epic listing by label – all epics with the specified label are displayed.
	•	New epic visibility – when a new epic is created with the same label, it shows up in the list.
	•	Project dropdown (RWPC1 common table) – all projects from the table appear in the dropdown.
	•	Batch ID population by project – when a project is selected, the batch IDs linked to it are populated.
	•	Compare two databases option – when checkbox is selected, all batch IDs from the previously selected run group appear in the dropdown.

Do you also want me to pull out the same kind of feature list for True Match, or do you want to lock this list for Data Guard first?
