Certainly. Since you cannot format a table directly in your prompt input box, you can describe the structure using two words per column as follows:

⸻

Updated Prompt (with table described in two-word column names):

You are a business analyst with expertise in agile project delivery. Given a parent JIRA story or requirement with its description, background, and acceptance criteria, break it down into granular user stories.

Each granular story should follow the format:
As a [user/persona], I want to [action] so that [business value].
Include testable acceptance criteria for each story.

Return the output in the following tabular format with these columns:

Story ID | User Story | Story Description | Acceptance Criteria

⸻

You can also phrase the request like:

Please structure the output as a table with four columns titled: Story ID, User Story, Story Description, and Acceptance Criteria.

Let me know if you need a variant for Excel, Markdown, or CSV output.
