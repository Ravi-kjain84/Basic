Hi Fred / Srinitha,

Basis on our conversation yesterday, I have collated the below points. Please suggest any changes in case in I have misunderstood or left any point:

Fred and Srinitha team are managing User Acceptance Testing that primarily involve in evaluating the transformation / changes received from projects or BAU level changes in RWA and Liquidity respectivily.

Testing CoE engagement with Fred and Srinitha's team should be more beneficial in terms of how end users would like to see the results of the Testing performed during Functional Testing. Their valuable feedback can help us to further make Testing outcomes more robust and better and faster  user acceptance.

Srinitha suggested for Testing COE to be in touch with Stephen's team related to Test cases reusability, Gen AI and automation perspective.

Fred suggested that the engagement with BAU teams should be channelized through the working group where we can focus more on how can we strengthen Testing further that support on better assurance and user acceptance and the results are more closer to actual BAU work.
