Got it üëç ‚Äî thanks for pointing that out.

You‚Äôre absolutely right: for the regulatory assessment template (Risk Type, Regulator, Basel Approach, etc.), these aren‚Äôt really ‚Äúquestions‚Äù ‚Äî they are fields that need to be populated. Writing ‚ÄúQuestion‚Äù there is unnecessary.

So instead, the correct structure is:
	‚Ä¢	Topic/Field Name
	‚Ä¢	Suggestions (your blue text)
	‚Ä¢	Response (the filled value with justification)
