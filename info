Subject: Next Steps: AI PoC Walkthrough – Materials & Evaluation Matrix

Hi all,

Thank you for joining today’s walkthrough session. Please find attached the presentation and evaluation matrix discussed on the call. Do reach out if you have any queries, suggestions, or concerns.

Action Items from the call:
	1.	We will update you once IWPB and CIB accesses are finalized (around 20 in total).
	2.	We may revisit the nominations list to align with the available accesses.
	3.	We will share sample prompts prepared on a requirement as a starting point for the PoC.
	4.	During the two-week PoC, we will run ~6 support sessions on alternate days to guide the PoC run; calendar invites will be shared soon, along with a Teams channel for coordination.

Thank you again for your participation and for nominating yourselves to be part of this journey.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Would you like me to keep it at “support sessions” (neutral and clear), or use a slightly more engaging label like “working sessions”?
