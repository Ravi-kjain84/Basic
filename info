Perfect üëç I now see the requirement summary fields from your screenshots (Test Data, New Data Sourcing, Data Masking, SDI, FCDP, RWA Calculation, etc.). These are very similar to the earlier regulatory context template ‚Äî but instead of risk/regulator-type fields, these are system/process requirement fields.

Let me rewrite the prompt in the exact same ‚ÄúField ‚Üí Suggestions ‚Üí Response‚Äù format for this set of requirement categories.

üîπ Refined Prompt for Requirement Summary Fields

Persona:
You are an experienced Finance Transformation leader with extensive expertise in Regulatory governance at HSBC.

For each field:
	1.	Keep the Field Name exactly as written below.
	2.	Keep the Suggestions exactly as written below.
	3.	Only generate the Response section.
	‚Ä¢	The Response must contain the most appropriate value (e.g., field names, ‚ÄúYes/No‚Äù, references to ETL, MI dashboards, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Provide a short justification, interpreting what the Basel requirement implies for the bank‚Äôs systems and processes.
	‚Ä¢	If the document does not explicitly provide the detail, infer the most reasonable value.

Would you like me to merge this new Requirement Summary template with your earlier Regulatory Context template so you end up with a single master prompt covering both (Regulatory fields + Requirement summary fields)?
