Understood. I have rephrased the opening sentence to make it sound inclusive and active, reflecting that we are jointly involved rather than implying he is uninvolved.

Here’s the refined version:

Subject: Extending AI POC Evaluation and License Requirement

Dear [Head of Finance Transformation’s Name],

As we are already working on the AI test case generation proof-of-concept (POC) with the IWPB team, the initiative has been very useful and is showing promising results. During this engagement, we also came across the other AI pilots and use cases that the IWPB team is running. Considering the potential of these solutions, the logical next step is to extend our evaluation to the full suite, allowing us to assess the broader benefits for Finance Transformation rather than focusing on a single use case.

To run this evaluation effectively, we will need to involve multiple value streams to assess the solutions against our current processes and transformation needs. Having around 20 licenses initially will allow us to conduct a structured evaluation, consolidate our findings, and work toward a formal report and target go-live by November.

It would be great if you could connect with Maxim to discuss the license allocation and explore how we can broaden our collaboration with IWPB for this extended evaluation.

Thank you for considering this approach. I believe this will help us realize the full potential of the AI solutions in our transformation journey.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Testing CoE Lead

This now:
	•	Opens with joint ownership and active involvement.
	•	Maintains professional yet natural tone.
	•	Keeps the chain of thought and collaboration intact.

I can now also craft a 3–4 line forwardable note that your Head of Transformation can quickly send to Maxim after this email to initiate the license discussion.

Would you like me to draft that?
