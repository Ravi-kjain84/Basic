Key Discussion Points – Meeting with Simon Chhen (IWPB Team)

Pros / Advantages of the Central Pool Model
	•	Flexible Resource Allocation:
	•	Resources can be assigned by percentage to different value streams or sites based on funding from VSIP.
	•	Ability to cross-utilize resources across value streams.
	•	Flexi Pool & SMEs:
	•	Dedicated value stream SMEs who can train other SMEs.
	•	Ring-fencing possible for specific value streams to ensure resource availability when needed.
	•	Technology Self-Sufficiency:
	•	Separate technology team to develop solutions independently when IT support is unavailable.
	•	Hired automation architect first, followed by automation resources, enabling internal capability building.
	•	Support for Peak Loads:
	•	Extra resources from the central pool can be provided to value streams during peak demand.
	•	Testing Leadership:
	•	Recommendation for each value stream to have a Testing Team Lead to manage and guide testing activities.

Cons / Limitations Highlighted
	•	UAT Focus Gap:
	•	Central pool resources focus mainly on change-related testing, not UAT or BAU, requiring BAU to handle initial stages.
	•	Resource Allocation Challenges:
	•	If pods outnumber available testers, allocation is percentage-based, which may dilute focus and ownership.
	•	Dependency on Allocation Data:
	•	Need to check historical resource allocation and peak demand data for effective planning.
	•	Potential Comfort Gap for Value Streams:
	•	Even with ring-fencing, some value streams may feel uncertain about resource continuity.

Suggested Additional Points (Not discussed but aligned with conversation)
	•	Clear SLAs for Central Pool Support:
	•	Define turnaround times for onboarding resources from the pool to avoid delays.
	•	Skill Matrix & Certification Tracking:
	•	Maintain a skills inventory for all central pool resources to enable faster and more accurate deployment.
	•	UAT Engagement Model:
	•	Introduce a partial UAT support framework so central pool testers can assist during critical releases.
	•	Automation Coverage Metrics:
	•	Track automation ROI to ensure the automation team delivers measurable benefits to all value streams.
	•	Forecasting & Demand Planning:
	•	Use historical allocation data to forecast future testing needs and adjust hiring proactively.

If you want, I can now condense this into a clean one-slide visual format where pros and cons are side-by-side, and suggested points appear in a separate box at the bottom so it’s presentation-ready. That will make it visually sharp for your PPT deck. Would you like me to prepare that version?
