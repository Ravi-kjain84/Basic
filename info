Perfect ‚úÖ ‚Äî I see that the screenshot is about Requirement Governance information fields (RWA Book of Work, Driver, BA, Sponsor, Approvals, Stakeholders, etc.), plus the Objective & Key Results (OKR) section.

Here‚Äôs a refined prompt in the same structured style we‚Äôve been building:

‚∏ª

üîπ Prompt for Requirement Governance Fields

‚∏ª

‚úÖ This way, the Requirement Governance section will always be populated in a clear, structured, and JIRA-ready format, with Suggestions kept and Responses inferred where possible.

üëâ Do you want me to also prepare a combined master prompt that brings together:
	‚Ä¢	Regulatory Context fields,
	‚Ä¢	Requirement Summary fields,
	‚Ä¢	Operating Model implications, and
	‚Ä¢	Requirement Governance fields,

‚Ä¶so you can generate one end-to-end requirements package in a single run?
