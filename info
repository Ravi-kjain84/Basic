Excellent ‚Äî I‚Äôll restructure the entire slide into a more balanced, executive-ready flow while keeping your new Objectives in place. The idea is to ensure consistency in style, sharper articulation, and clear linkage from Objective ‚Üí Challenges ‚Üí Approach ‚Üí Benefits ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Future State.

Here‚Äôs the revised version:

‚∏ª

Testing Center of Excellence

Objective
	‚Ä¢	Enhance efficiency, flexibility, and quality of testing processes by centralizing resources.
	‚Ä¢	Drive efficiency gains through cross-utilization of testing resources across value streams.
	‚Ä¢	Enable scalable implementation and execution of Automation and AI solutions.
	‚Ä¢	Achieve phased efficiency improvements: ~15% from automation and an additional ~15% from AI adoption within 6‚Äì18 months (2026‚Äì27) of establishing the common resource pool.

‚∏ª

Current Challenges
	‚Ä¢	Limited automation and redundant manual testing efforts.
	‚Ä¢	Inconsistent test case quality and lack of traceability.
	‚Ä¢	UAT environments often misaligned with production.

‚∏ª

Strategic Approach
	‚Ä¢	Central Pool Formation: Establish a centralized testing resource pool for flexible allocation and cross-utilization.
	‚Ä¢	Standardization, Automation & Gen AI: Implement test automation frameworks and leverage Gen AI for test case generation.
	‚Ä¢	Training & Skill Building: Rotate resources across projects to accelerate skill development and adaptability.

‚∏ª

Benefits
	‚Ä¢	Cost Reduction: 15% reduction in testing effort through automation and standardization; additional 15% through AI over time.
	‚Ä¢	Quality Improvement: Improved test coverage, early defect detection, and reliable traceability.
	‚Ä¢	Resource Optimization: Efficient management of peak loads and future demand across value streams.

‚∏ª

Implementation Plan
	‚Ä¢	Align resources to CoE, initiate skill mapping, and deploy AI-driven solutions.
	‚Ä¢	Embed testing specialists within Agile teams for integrated planning, faster feedback, and smoother execution.
	‚Ä¢	Scale AI-driven test automation in a phased manner to realize efficiency targets.

‚∏ª

Future State
	‚Ä¢	Seamless Agile integration with short sprints and Gen AI‚Äìdriven test case generation.
	‚Ä¢	Continuous improvement through KPI/OKR-driven feedback loops.
	‚Ä¢	Establishment of a scalable, adaptive testing ecosystem capable of supporting evolving business and regulatory needs.

‚∏ª

üîë Now the flow is unified:
	‚Ä¢	Objectives set the ambition.
	‚Ä¢	Challenges create urgency.
	‚Ä¢	Strategic Approach provides the ‚Äúhow‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢	Benefits quantify the value.
	‚Ä¢	Implementation Plan shows the path.
	‚Ä¢	Future State paints the end vision.

Would you like me to also create a 1-slide executive summary version (very high-level, 5‚Äì6 bullets) for senior stakeholders who prefer brevity?
