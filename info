Subject: Re: Gen AI & Automation demo to ESG team: Testing CoE Priorities and Targets

Hi Damon, hope you are doing well.

Yes, Anu has shared the details and I’m working on it. We’ve made good progress on the AI solution design through a POC with the controllership team, where the scope has expanded from requirement analysis to Jira templates, design documents, and test cases.

On engagement and AI solution perspective, we are in discussions with IWPB, CIB, and Treasury IT to finalize the POC approach from a Finance Transformation standpoint, involving various value streams as well. I’ll set up a call next week to walk you through the details and also give a demo of the ongoing work.

For automation, we are working with IT and value stream teams to design a single solution that can serve all testing colleagues across business and technology. The first draft of this solution is expected from IT by the end of the year.

Regarding the point around Testing CoE resourcing, there is currently a discussion in progress with senior management to finalize the target operating model. I plan to share an update on this by September–October as the discussions progress.

Thanks,
Ravi

Do you also want me to prepare a shorter version (3–4 tight paragraphs) that you can use if you feel the recipient prefers very quick reads?
