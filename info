Hi Simon,
Hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out in my capacity as Testing CoE Lead for Finance Transformation.

We’re currently reviewing the testing operating models across different businesses, and I wanted to understand how testing is structured within IWPB—specifically how teams are aligned to value streams, projects, and reporting lines.

I can see from the org chart that you’re leading the testing capability for IWPB, and it would be great to hear more about how your area is organized.

Would it be possible to set up a quick catch-up this week at your convenience?

Thanks in advance.

Best regards,
Ravi

Let me know if you’d like a slightly more formal or informal variant.
