Subject: GenAI Test Case POC – Progress Update

Dear Roshan and Team,

Sharing a quick update on the GenAI-based test case generation POC.

The POC has been initiated and is currently in progress. We have received access to the Alice environment and are now able to generate test cases based on the provided requirements. While the solution is still at a nascent stage, the initial outputs have been quite promising and offer practical value.

We are in the process of reviewing these test cases in collaboration with the testing team to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement. This review will help us refine the approach and assess its broader applicability.

In parallel, we are engaging with the Treasury IT and IWPB teams, who are working on similar use cases. The IWPB team has provided temporary access to their solution, which has also shown strong potential. Their solution, currently in the pilot phase, is integrated with Jira and addresses several of our test case requirements. They are also planning enhancements to enable parsing of additional sources such as policy documents, which could further enrich the generated output.

A follow-up meeting with the IWPB team is scheduled for tomorrow to explore potential collaboration and alignment of efforts.

As the POC progresses, we are also factoring in the controls and governance considerations that will be critical for embedding this capability within the target operating model.

Will share further updates following tomorrow’s discussion.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
