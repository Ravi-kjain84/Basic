Certainly. Here’s a revised version with a more modest and collaborative tone:

Subject: Request for Access to GitHub Copilot

Hi Tenzin,

I hope you’re doing well.

As part of the Testing CoE, I’ve been working on a few Python-based automation POCs aimed at improving efficiency in testing. Some of these have been shared with the IT team and are being considered as part of ongoing discussions around process improvement.

I’ve noticed that GitHub Copilot is widely available within the IT teams. Given its capabilities, I believe it could greatly support the development and refinement of such solutions—particularly when adapting them across different data sources.

I’m currently looking to request access for myself to help accelerate this work. Could you please advise if there’s a process I should follow?

Thank you, as always, for your support.

Best regards,
Ravi
