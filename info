Subject: Need Clarity – Gurgaon Visit Calendar Slots

Hi Kiran,

I was checking your calendar for the period 15–17 July, but couldn’t find any available slots. Just wanted to confirm if the time has already been blocked for the Gurgaon visit.

Shall I go ahead and use these three days to schedule your meetings accordingly, or is there anything specific I should keep in mind while planning?

Regards,
Ravi
