Subject: RE: Testing CoE Priorities and Targets – Leadership Connect

Dear Dishan,

Is there a specific reason why value stream IT teams were not included in this session? Has a separate joint session been planned with IT and FCD? The current session involved most senior testing leads from Transformation and FinOps, based on Rob’s consolidated data across value streams. While we have regular connects with the IT team through our Advisory Group meetings, their testing-related efforts appear to be aligned within their own POD structures under common roles, and they have not explicitly highlighted Testing-specific resources.

Additionally, regarding test automation packs for each value stream, active engagement from IT is essential. While value streams may propose their own solutions or design/review them through PoCs, formalizing these requirements with IT is necessary so they can be developed and owned appropriately. Currently, we have initiated several automation solutions under PoC, and have raised corresponding JIRA requirements for IT to scale and eventually own these implementations.

Best regards,
Ravi Kumar Jain
SVP, Testing CoE Lead
