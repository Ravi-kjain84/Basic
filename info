Subject: RE: Next steps: Testing CoE Priorities and Targets

Hi Atifa,

As per the current Testing CoE Priorities and Targets, we would like to follow up with the testing teams involved across different VS/SVS. I have included the high-level hierarchy view from Rob’s sheet for Treasury.

We would need inputs from both Liquidity and IRRBB streams, as the underlying systems and testing approaches differ.
	•	Naveen Singla is part of the Testing Advisory Group (nominated by Richard) and had connected me to Saurabh Saxena, who has a strong understanding of the area. I would suggest having either Naveen or Saurabh nominate someone from their team (or we can proceed with Saurabh if preferable).
	•	Arjun and Ray are already part of the ongoing discussions and could either continue in the working group or nominate a representative.
	•	So far, we have had no interaction from Jothi’s area. It would be helpful to identify a contact point from her team to initiate discussions and represent the area in the working group.
	•	Similarly, for Ram and Milena, we haven’t engaged with their respective teams yet. I would request Stephen to identify someone suitable to join from their side.

This could serve as the initial high-level RACI based on current visibility and expectations from the VS/SVS side.

Best regards,
Ravi
