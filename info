Subject: Collaboration on GenAI Testing Solution

Hi,

I am Ravi Jain, leading the Testing CoE for Finance Transformation. We have initiated a GenAI PoC for generating test cases from requirements and related documents, and are now considering extending it to cover requirement refinement, user stories, and high-level design. I had also briefly connected with Seb through Piyush, as our PoCs were similar.

Yesterday, Ruchan shared the articles, and it was great to see the progress made by our Treasury IT team. The solution seems highly relevant for Finance Transformation, and I would like to explore the feasibility of collaborating and extending it for wider use. Would you be open to a short call? I can coordinate a suitable time.

Best regards,
Ravi Jain
