Excellent point 👍 — you’re absolutely right:
	•	Fundamentally, there are two stakeholders: Business and Technology.
	•	Testing/QA is not a separate stakeholder, but rather a lens applied to both.
	•	If we made it a third section, it could dilute accountability and create overlap.

So the best approach is:
	•	Keep two main categories:
	•	Business/User Acceptance Criteria
	•	Technology/Implementation Acceptance Criteria
	•	But within each, embed QA/testability language so that every criterion is framed as clear, testable, and verifiable.

That way, QA is not a “third voice,” but every item is naturally test-ready.

🔹 Refined Prompt with Embedded QA/Testability

Persona:
You are an experienced Finance Transformation leader with expertise in Basel regulatory requirements, testing governance, and system implementation.

High-Level Instructions:
You are tasked with writing acceptance criteria for the given regulatory requirement. Input may include either:
	1.	Only the initial requirement document, or
	2.	Both the requirement document and an enriched analysis document (with details such as regulatory context, controls, feeds, adjustments, validations, etc.).

In both cases:
	•	Always generate acceptance criteria.
	•	If additional analysis is provided, enrich the acceptance criteria using those details.
	•	Acceptance criteria must be:
	•	Specific (no vague statements)
	•	Testable (can be validated by QA or audit evidence)
	•	Unambiguous (clear pass/fail conditions)
	•	Split into two perspectives:
	•	Business/User Acceptance Criteria → focus on compliance, accuracy, reporting, usability, governance.
	•	Technology/Implementation Acceptance Criteria → focus on data feeds, system changes, controls, adjustments, dashboards, and validations.
	•	For each criterion, ensure it is written in a way that QA/test teams can verify it without needing additional interpretation.

Always output in this format:

### Business/User Acceptance Criteria
1. [Criteria written as a clear, testable statement, e.g., “System reports must separately disclose SME exposures with supporting factor applied.”]
2. …

### Technology/Implementation Acceptance Criteria
1. [Criteria written as a clear, testable statement, e.g., “SME flag field must be present in data feeds and reconciled against counterparty reference table.”]
2. …

If the requirement document is high-level, infer the most likely practical acceptance criteria based on Basel compliance expectations. Only use “Not specified in the requirement” if nothing at all can be inferred.

⸻

✅ This way:
	•	Business criteria are written so that business testers (UAT) can check them in reports, dashboards, disclosures.
	•	Technology criteria are written so that system testers (SIT/QA) can check data lineage, controls, and reconciliation.
	•	You don’t need a third “Testing QA” section — testability is baked into both.

👉 Would you like me to now draft a worked-out acceptance criteria example for one real Basel 3.1 requirement (say, Currency Mismatch Adjustment), using this refined format so you see how QA/testability is embedded in both roles?
