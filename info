Subject: Meeting Request: Connect with Kiran Pisapati (Head – Finance Transformation CoE)

Dear [Name],

Hope you’re doing well.

As suggested by Arpita, I’m reaching out to set up a brief connect between you and Kiran Pisapati, who has recently joined as the Head of Finance Transformation CoE. Kiran will be at the Gurugram office between 15th and 17th July, and is looking forward to meeting colleagues leading key initiatives.

I’ll be setting up the call and will share a proposed time shortly based on your availability.

Thanks in advance,
Ravi
