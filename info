Subject: Extending AI POC Evaluation and License Requirement

Dear [Head of Finance Transformation’s Name],

As we are already working on the AI test case generation POC with the IWPB team, the initiative has been very useful and is showing promising results. We also came across other AI pilots they are running, and expanding our evaluation to the full suite will help us assess the broader benefits for Finance Transformation.

To carry out a structured evaluation, we will need to involve multiple value streams, and an initial allocation of around 20 licenses will enable us to consolidate findings and move toward a formal report and target go-live by November.

It would be great if you could connect with Maxim to discuss the license allocation and broaden our collaboration with IWPB.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Testing CoE Lead

This version is:
	•	Shorter and easy to scan for executives.
	•	Keeps the collaborative and positive tone.
	•	Retains all key points: current POC, expansion, license need, timeline, and next step.

If you want, I can shrink it further into a 4–5 line executive note for very quick reading.

Would you like me to prepare that version too?
